          <ul>
            <ul><b><u>Before You Begin:</u></b><br></ul>
            <ul><b>Back Up Data:</b> Backup any important data or files from your device to ensure you don't lose any information during the sell process. <br></ul>
            <ul><b>Factory Reset Your Phone:</b> To protect your privacy and ensure that the next owner starts with a clean slate, perform a factory reset on your phone. A factory reset will erase all data on your device and restore it to its original settings. To do this, go to your device's settings, find the "Reset" or "Backup & Reset" option, and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to remove any memory cards or SIM cards from the device before resetting it.<br></ul>
            <ul><b>Remove Your Accounts:</b> Before selling your phone, it's important to remove any accounts associated with it. This includes your Google or Apple account, as well as any other accounts linked to apps and services on your device. This step helps prevent the new owner from accessing your accounts and personal information.<br></ul>

            <ul><b>Disable Factory Reset Protection (FRP):</b> If your Android device has Factory Reset Protection (FRP) enabled, make sure to disable it before performing the factory reset. FRP is a security feature that requires the previous Google account credentials to set up the device after a reset. You can disable FRP in the device's settings under "Security" or "Accounts."<br></ul>
      

            <ul>By following these steps, you can protect your data and privacy while ensuring that your used phone is ready for a new owner. It's essential to take these precautions to avoid any potential issues and provide a positive experience for the buyer.<br></ul>
