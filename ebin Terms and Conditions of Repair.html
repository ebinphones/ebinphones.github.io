          <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
          <ul>
          <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ebin and its related services (collectively referred to as the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Service.</p>
          </ul> 
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h3>Use of the Service</h3>
          <p><b>1.1</b> Eligibility: You must be at least 13 years old to use this Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are of legal age to form a binding contract.</p>

          <p><b>1.2</b> Registration: You may need to create an account to access certain features of the Service. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information during the registration process and to update such information to keep it accurate, current, and complete.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-4">
          <h3>Repair Services</h3>
          <p><b>2.1</b> Service Overview: ebin's Repair feature allows users to access high-quality repair shops across the United States at competitive prices. Users can set up appointments through the App for a hassle-free repair experience.</p>
          <p><b>2.2</b> Appointment Booking: Users can schedule repair appointments through the App. Ebin facilitates the appointment scheduling process, eliminating the need for users to search for repair shops or call to set up appointments. While Ebin strives to connect users with reputable repair shops, we do not endorse, guarantee, or verify the quality of the repair services provided by third-party repair shops. Users are responsible for their interactions and transactions with repair shops.</p>
          <p><b>2.3</b> Mail-In Repairs: Ebin offers the option for users to mail in their electronic devices for repair services. Users are responsible for securely packaging and shipping their devices to designated repair centers. Ebin facilitates the process by providing instructions for mail-in repairs. </p>
          <p><b>2.4</b> Use of Aftermarket Parts: All Ebin Certified* repair shops exclusively utilize aftermarket parts for all repair services they offer. These parts are sourced from third-party manufacturers rather than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Aftermarket parts are selected to provide cost-effective repair solutions while maintaining compatibility and functionality equivalent to that of the OEM parts.</p> 
          <p><b>2.5</b> Warranty Considerations: Customers who opt for repairs at Ebin Certified* repair shops using aftermarket parts should be aware that the use of these parts may have implications for warranties and guarantees on their devices. It's advisable to inquire about warranty coverage and seek clarification on any potential impacts on the manufacturer's warranty before proceeding with the repair.</p>
          <p><b>2.6</b> Incorrect Serial/IMEI: Please note that if users input an incorrect serial/IMEI, it may potentially delay the repair process.
          <p><b>2.7</b> Blacklisted Devices: We do not accept blacklisted devices for servicing.</p>
          <p><b>2.8</b> Post-Repair Claims: If customers request a repair and we replace the damaged part during our final diagnostic, and everything works, but the user claims that other damage was done after the repairs, users cannot blame us for bad workmanship if other damage occurred to the device after the repair, even though we conducted a final diagnostic test before returning the device.</p>
          <p><b>2.9</b> Recycling Unclaimed Devices: We shall make reasonable efforts to repair your Device subject to the availability of any parts required and/or the terms of any relevant guarantee or warranty. We shall perform the Service using our utmost care and skill. We shall notify you when the Device has been repaired. If necessary, we shall send a reminder, and if the device is not collected by day 90, it may be recycled to cover our costs for bring-in repair. If we are unable to complete the Service for any reason, or the Service will incur further costs payable by you beyond that initially estimated by us, we will notify you immediately via telephone and/or email. If no fault is found on your Device or you do not accept our revised estimate, we will return your Device to you unrepaired, and we reserve the right to charge you an inspection fee in accordance with our standard charges. We shall be entitled to keep your Device until all charges payable have been paid.</p>
          <p><b>2.10</b> Manufacturer's Warranty: Use of our service may void your manufacturer’s warranty. If you would like to avoid this, then please take your Device directly to the manufacturer. Please note, your manufacturer’s warranty will not cover any accidental damage. Ebin will install warranty seals following the repair. Any tampering of the seals will void our warranty.</p>
          <p><b>2.11</b> Warranty Details: The Warranty is linked to a specific device as identified by its unique IMEI or serial number and to a specific Customer as identified by the records on our system. It will cover the Customer for any re-occurrence of the original fault and for the part replaced/ repaired only. However, if additional faults arise, they will not be covered under the terms of this Warranty. Furthermore, the Warranty will not cover accidental damage, nor will the cover extend should the device change ownership. We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage where your Device has been repaired elsewhere prior to your repair by ebin or any issues found in your Device (i.e. ‘Touch Disease’, ripped flex) which were not evident upon initial inspection. Should any issues become evident once the Device is opened, we will contact you via telephone/email.</p>
          <p><b>2.12</b> Liquid Damage: We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid. Opening the Device could set off further damage which in some cases may be very serious and irreparable. We ask our Customers to monitor their Device post liquid damage repair, as unknown issues can arise soon after treatment for liquid damage, which are beyond our control. Following repair, any water proofing or resistance cannot be guaranteed.</p>
          <p><b>2.13</b> Beyond Economical Repair: If your Device is damaged beyond economical repair as a direct result of a service or repair undertaken by us, you are entitled to a fully functional refurbished device of equal value to your Device, based on its model and condition as received and with the original repair issue resolved. In order to receive a replacement device, full payment must have been received for the repair service, and the relevant damaged device must be surrendered to us.</p>
          <p><b>2.14</b> Liability: Any data or information that you may have stored on the Device shall remain your sole responsibility, and we accept no liability for loss or corruption of such data however caused. We therefore highly recommend that you back up your Device onto an external drive prior to commissioning our Service. It is your responsibility to keep a record of any such data.</p>
