          <h3>Repair Services</h3>
          <p><b>2.1</b> Service Overview: ebin's Bring-In Repair feature allows users to access high-quality repair shops across the United States at competitive prices. Users can set up appointments through the App for a hassle-free repair experience.</p>
          <p><b>2.2</b> Appointment Booking: Users can schedule repair appointments through the App. Ebin facilitates the appointment scheduling process, eliminating the need for users to search for repair shops or call to set up appointments. While ebin strives to connect users with reputable repair shops, we do not guarantee or verify the quality of the repair services provided by third-party repair shops. Users are responsible for their interactions and transactions with repair shops.</p>
          <p><b>2.3</b> Mail-In Repairs: Ebin offers the option for users to mail in their electronic devices for repair services. Users are responsible for securely packaging and shipping their devices to designated repair centers. Ebin facilitates the process by providing instructions for mail-in repairs which includes shipping label. </p>
          <p><b>2.4</b> Use of Aftermarket Parts: All Ebin Certified* repair shops exclusively utilize aftermarket parts for all repair services they offer. These parts are sourced from third-party manufacturers rather than the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). Aftermarket parts are selected to provide cost-effective repair solutions while maintaining compatibility and functionality equivalent to that of the OEM parts.</p> 
          <p><b>2.5</b> Warranty Considerations: Customers who opt for repairs at Ebin Certified* repair shops using aftermarket parts should be aware that the use of these parts may have implications for warranties and guarantees on their devices. It's advisable to inquire about warranty coverage and seek clarification on any potential impacts on the manufacturer's warranty before proceeding with the repair.</p>
          <p><b>2.6</b> Incorrect Serial/IMEI: Please note that if users input an incorrect serial/IMEI, it may potentially delay the repair process.
          <p><b>2.7</b> Blacklisted Devices: We do not accept blacklisted devices for servicing.</p>
          <li>Additional Information: A Blacklists IMEI refers to the International Mobile Equipment Identity number of a mobile device that has been reported as lost, stolen, or blocked by the device's owner, carrier, or relevant authorities. When an IMEI is blacklisted, it typically means that the device cannot be used on mobile networks, and it may also be ineligible for certain services or support from carriers and providers. Devices with blacklisted IMEIs are often restricted from activation and usage to prevent unauthorized or fraudulent use of the device.</li>
          <p><b>2.8</b> Post-Repair Claims: For Ship-In repair orders, when we replace the damaged part during our final diagnostic, we conduct a comprehensive final diagnostic test before returning the device to the customer. Since the device passed our rigorous test, any damage that occurs to the device after the repair, whether related or unrelated, is not attributed to our workmanship. If the device does not pass our rigorous test, ebin will retry the repair. If the device needs other repairs we will contact the customer. If the device is deemed unrepairable by the ebin technician, ebin will return the device to the customer in the condition it was received. It's important to note that we cannot be held responsible for any subsequent damage to the device. For Bring-In repair orders, please contact the repair shop that performed the repair for any post-repair claims.</p>
          <p><b>2.10</b> Manufacturer's Warranty: Use of our service may void your manufacturer’s warranty. If you would like to avoid this, then please take your device directly to the manufacturer. Please note, your manufacturer’s warranty will not cover any accidental damage. For Ship-In repairs, ebin will install warranty seals following the repair. Any tampering of the seals will void our warranty.</p>
          <p><b>2.11</b> Warranty Details: The Warranty is linked to a specific device as identified by its unique IMEI or serial number and to a specific Customer as identified by the records on our system. It will cover the Customer for any re-occurrence of the original fault. Please refer Service Warranty section for details. For the part replaced/ repaired only. However, if additional faults arise, they will not be covered under the terms of this Warranty. Furthermore, the Warranty will not cover accidental damage, nor will the cover extend should the device change ownership. We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage where your device has been repaired elsewhere prior to your repair by ebin or any issues found in your device (i.e. ‘Touch Disease’, ripped flex) which were not evident upon initial inspection. Should any issues become evident once the Device is opened, we will contact you via telephone/email.</p>
          <p><b>2.12</b> Liquid Damage: We do not accept responsibility for any progression in damage for Devices that have been damaged by liquid. Opening the Device could set off further damage which in some cases may be very serious and irreparable. We ask our Customers to monitor their Device post liquid damage repair, as unknown issues can arise soon after treatment for liquid damage, which are beyond our control. Following repair, any water proofing or resistance cannot be guaranteed.</p>
          <p><b>2.13</b> Damage During The Repair Process: If your device is damaged during the repair as a direct result of a service or repair undertaken by us, you are entitled to a fully functional refurbished device of equal value to your device, based on its model and condition as received and with the original repair issue resolved. In order to receive a replacement device, full payment must have been received for the repair service, and the relevant damaged device must be surrendered to us.</p>
          <p><b>2.14</b> Liability: Any data or information that you may have stored on the Device shall remain your sole responsibility, and we accept no liability for loss or corruption of such data however caused. We therefore highly recommend that you back up your device onto an external drive prior to commissioning our Service. It is your responsibility to keep a record of any such data.</p>
